# Badges
Code-in-Place final project - Badge creator in Python 3.8
BADGE CREATOR is a program I created for my final project in Stanford University's Code in Place 2021

The program accepts user input for elements of an award badge:
    the base shape, including its color, an inner shape, icon and the text to display
then it creates an badge image by first creating the user-selected base in the selected color then layering each of the additional elements and the user text
The program both displays the image and saves it in a file.

Problems solved:

- how to access the correct shape or icon files by name

- how to change the color on the base shape 

- how to layer the images--and preserve the transparency of the final file

- how to easily add elements to the selection lists

The result:
a program that quickly and easily creates a badge 



There a few ways I would like to make this program better

- add an algorithm so that the user can be change the text size for the award and still center it properly

- improve image quality

- perhaps have more elements subject to color selection, more icons, letting the user upload an icon

- and of course, making sure the program can handle the wrong user inputs without crashing.
